        Hello!

        Over the last year, I have taught myself computer engineering; completed the 13 week, JS immersive at Fullstack Academy of Code; and moved to SF to pursue a career in web development.
        Before that, I worked in sales in NYC (2 yrs).
        Before that I worked as an R&D chemist (1 yr) and taught post-secondary Chemistry in SW Missouri(4 yrs).

        I'm a pretty considerate person. I listen to lots of music and podcasts, go outside often, and play nerd-games. But recently, I mostly think about Javascript.

        Right now, I'm diving into Web Components via Polymer. It seems as though iChemLabs been on to them for years though; I would enjoy gaining your perspectives on the spec.
        My personal site is: www.wesley.tech

        Look forward to hearing from you!
      </p>
