    <p>
      Unprompted, my four year old niece screamed that at me several times this past weekend, so I'll take it
      as a sign.

    <p>
      While I'd never want to be a 'perfectionist,' I would absolutely call myself an 'excellencist,' if you will
      allow that word extensioon
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the last year, I taught myself to program; completed a the JS immersive at Fullstack Academy of
      Code (8% acceptance rate); and moved to SF to pursue a career in web development and software
      engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before that, I worked in sales in NYC (2 yrs).
    </p>

    <p>
      Before that I worked as an R&D chemist (1 yr) and taught post-secondary Chemistry in SW Missouri(4 yrs).
    </p>

    <p>
      I try hard to be a considerate person and act honestly with myself and others. I listen to lots
      of music and podcasts, go outside often, and play nerd-games. But recently, I only think about
      Javascript.
    </p>

    <p>
      My biggest weakness is over-sharing and talking over others sometimes, but I'm working on that...
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, my best-self is boundlessly enthusiastic and cares deeply for people and puts all my
      energy towards connecting and encouraging them. I am a pretty serious force multiplier
      when I'm cranking on all cylinders.
